# PowerCheck
A small utility that allows you to monitor the state of charge of the battery. When the charge reaches 70% or more, a small window is displayed on Tkinter that informs about this, and when the charge is 50% or less, a window with a message is also displayed. The program runs in the background through an infinite loop. Tested under Windows, you can add to autoload yourself.
